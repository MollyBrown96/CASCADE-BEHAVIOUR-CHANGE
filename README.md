# Behaviour Change for Achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework - R Application

## Overview

This R application supports access to data sources related to the evidence synthesis on behaviour change interventions for biodiversity conservation. It is based on the "Behaviour Change for Achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework" evidence synthesis, which presents successful interventions designed to influence human behaviour to meet biodiversity conservation targets. The app aims to provide users with tools to explore case studies, examine intervention strategies, and understand the effectiveness of behaviour change efforts on biodiversity outcomes.

## Features

- **Case Study Explorer**: View and filter case studies from across the globe that have implemented behaviour change strategies to conserve biodiversity.

## Installation

To use this R application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   ```bash
   install.packages(c("shiny", "shinyBS", "bslib", "DT", "reader"))

3. **Launch the Application**
   After the packages are installed, you can run the application with:
   ```bash
   shiny::runApp()

## Case Study Explorer

Explore a wide range of case studies categorised by the KMGBF biodiversity targets they address. You can filter by region, behaviour change strategy, or target audience to focus on interventions most relevant to your interests.

## Data Sources

The data used in this application is based on an extensive review of approximately 75 case studies drawn from the "Behaviour Change for Achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework" report. The interventions target key biodiversity goals outlined in the KM-GBF targets 4, 5, 10, and 16.
