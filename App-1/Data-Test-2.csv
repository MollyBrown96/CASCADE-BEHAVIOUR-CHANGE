Protecting the protected: reducing wildlife roadkill in protected areas,South Africa,"Social media discussions highlight public concern for wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) inside protected areas. Using a quasi-experimental field trial, we investigated factors affecting the likelihood of WVCs within Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, and assessed the comparative effectiveness of wildlife-warning signage (WWS) for altering driver behaviour. We laid a dummy snake crosswise on roads across four combinations of habitat and road shape and recorded 10 driver-related variables for 1454 vehicles that passed the dummy snake, including whether there was a collision. An interaction between speeding and driver occupation (staff/visitor) was the best indicator for WVC. When driving below the speed limit, visitors were almost three times more likely than staff to hit the dummy snake. Collision probabilities increased when speeding and became more similar between visitors and staff, although still significantly higher for visitors. We then investigated the effectiveness of roadside signage in modifying driver behaviour by erecting four variations of WWS, depicting a snake or a cheetah, and in photographic or silhouette form. We positioned the dummy snake 100 m or 1 km after the signage and recorded our 10 variables (n = 6400 vehicles). Sixty-one percent of drivers who passed a WWS changed their behaviour when they saw the dummy snake, compared to 37% with no sign present. Further, this behaviour change significantly reduced collisions, where 98% of drivers who changed their behaviour avoided a collision. Finally, an interaction between the animal depicted and distance before the dummy snake affected collisions. A WWS depicting a snake, and placed 100 m before the dummy snake, was most effective at reducing collisions. Our results suggest that drivers adapt their behaviour to signage that portrays smaller animals and awareness retention is low. Ultimately, to reduce WVCs within protected areas, we suggest steeper penalties for speeding and WWS placed in WVC hotpot areas.

"The Impact of Message Framing on Wildlife Approach During Ungulate Viewing Experiences in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem
",USA,"Every year, millions of people visit parks and protected areas to view wildlife. Conflict between people and ungulates is prominent, and many incidents occur when people approach ungulates at proximities less than the National Park Service regulation of 25 yards. The purpose of this study was to test how wildlife viewing communication messages impact park visitors’ approach behavior. A survey and walking exercise were conducted with life-sized ungulate cutouts on a 100-yard transect in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks to test the influence of three message frames (i.e., current NPS messaging, resource protection messaging, and a visitor experience message) on visitors’ approach behaviors. Park visitors overestimated proximity when given current park messaging. Additionally, the resource protection- and the visitor experience-framed messages led to more conservative wildlife approach compared to current park messaging. These results have practical applications for influencing visitors’ behaviors and reducing human-wildlife conflict through education and interpretation.

"The effectiveness of regulatory signs in controlling human behaviour and Northern gannet (Morus bassanus) disturbance during breeding: an experimental test
","Great Saltee island, Ireland","Human disturbance to wildlife is on the rise and disturbance management is a key activity in conservation. Although disturbance can be controlled with relative ease in nature reserves that are properly resourced and managed by employed staff, most reserves do not fall into this category, and most wildlife exists outside managed reserves entirely. Thus, developing and demonstrating the effectiveness of simple, low-cost approaches to minimising disturbance is an important objective in conservation. In this study we examine the effectiveness of regulatory signs in controlling the behaviour and impacts of visitors on a colonial island-nesting bird, the Northern gannet (Morus bassanus), on an unmanaged island. First, we found that the percentage of successful nests declined with proximity to the disturbed edge of the colony, and was much higher in an undisturbed control area. Second, the number of birds displaced by visitors correlated negatively with the minimum visitor approach distance. Third, visitor proximity to the colony was dramatically reduced in the presence of a regulatory sign in comparison to periods without signs, which resulted in fewer birds being displaced from their nests. Photographers were the only visitor group who didn’t always comply with the sign. Our results show that breeding success in a species often thought to be well adapted to human presence, suffers from tourist pressure, and that simple and informative regulatory signs can be a cost-effective way of reducing the disturbance caused by visitors at unmanaged wildlife sites.

"Social influence and forest habitat conservation (Vermont, USA)",USA,"Working landscapes can provide biodiversity and ecosystem services. Many voluntary conservation programs ask those who manage working lands—farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners—to steward their resources in ways that maintain or increase these benefits. While research on landowners suggests the importance of social influence in management decisions, few studies have tested whether providing information about the behavior and opinions of others affects decisions related to private land and forest management, stewardship, or conservation. Using a randomized controlled trial design, we mailed three versions of a solicitation letter for a bird habitat conservation program to 967 individuals who manage forests to produce maple syrup. Maple producers who were messaged about recognition for participation were as likely to ask for more information about the program as those who received only a control message that described the program. Providing information about the participation of others had a negative effect on the number of producers requesting information compared to the control. These results highlight the importance of context in using social influence to change land manager behavior. Findings are relevant to conservation researchers and practitioners, offering applications of behavioral science to improve biodiversity and ecosystem service outcomes on private lands.

"Impact of Farmer Field School on Crop Income, Agroecology, and Farmer’s Behavior in Farming: A Case Study on Cumilla District in Bangladesh
",Bangladesh,"The Farmer Field School (FFS) is a season-long training for farmers involving participatory activities and interactive learning with the doctrine of integrated pest management and agroecosystem analysis. It has become a popular education and extension approach worldwide. This study tried to evaluate the FFS as a vehicle for sustainable agriculture which has economic viability, ecological soundness, and social acceptability. The study aimed to analyze the impact of the FFS on crop income, agroecology, and farmers’ behavior in farming. The empirical models, such as propensity score matching, Mahalanobis distance matching, and difference in differences, were applied for estimating the impact of FFS on crop income, more specifically, real income from brinjal. The environmental impact quotient was used to assess the agroecological impact of using pesticide, and a graded response model was used to investigate farmer behavioral changes in farming. The treatment effect based on the empirical models has shown a positive, significant effect on crop income. The findings also revealed that FFS farmers had a lower agroecological impact from pesticide use, and their behavior in farming practices was improved. Therefore, FFS was demonstrated to be a key strategy in strengthening agricultural extension services, which will contribute to promoting sustainable agriculture.

"Motivating rice farmers in the Mekong Delta to modify pest management and related practices through mass media
",Vietnam,"A participatory planning process was applied to develop a media campaign to motivate rice farmers in the Mekong Delta to modify pest management practices together with seed and fertilizer inputs. Locally named ‘Ba Giam Ba Tang’ or ‘Three Reductions, Three Gains’, campaigns were launched in two provinces, Can Tho and Tien Giang. In both provinces, farmers' practices changed significantly. Their insecticide sprays reduced by 13–33% while their seed rates dropped ∼10% and nitrogen rates, ∼7% and proportion of farmers using insecticides declined by ∼11%. These practices were supported by modifications in belief attitudes that favored high inputs. Farmers who reported significant reductions in the three inputs also changed their perception of yield loss. The campaigns in Can Tho and Tien Giang had significant multiplier effects. They stimulated several provincial governments as well as the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to provide additional resources to reproduce the materials and campaign process for local use which eventually reached more than 3 million farmers in south and central Vietnam.

"Extension services can promote pasture restoration: Evidence from Brazil’s low carbon agriculture plan
",Brazil,"Innovation and improved practices in the livestock sector represent key opportunities to meet global climate goals. This paper provides evidence that extension services can promote pasture restoration in cattle ranching in Brazil. We use a randomized controlled trial implemented in the context of the ABC Cerrado (a large-scale program launched in 2014 aimed at fostering technology adoption through a combination of training and technical assistance) to examine the effects of different types of extension on agricultural practices, input use, and productivity. Providing technical assistance to previously trained producers promoted pasture restoration, induced farmers to use inputs more intensively, helped them to improve their management and soil conservation practices, and substantially increased revenues. A cost–benefit calculation indicates that US$1 invested in the ABC Cerrado program increased profits by US$1.08 to $1.45. Incorporating carbon savings amplifies this return considerably.","TARGET 10: Enhance Biodiversity and Sustainability in Agriculture, Aquaculture, Fisheries, and Forestry

Social referents and normative standards affect perceptions of livestock management behaviors,Kenya,"Social influence impacts individuals’ behavior through norms – the perceived appropriateness of behaviors – and social referents, whose behavior is copied by others. Interventions using social influence may help promote conservation-friendly behaviors. We explored how perceptions are influenced by descriptive norms (what people do) and social referents (who does it) in relation to livestock management in Kenya. By presenting participants with vignettes describing different livestock management scenarios, we explored how two norms (‘high’ vs. ‘low’ standards of livestock management) and three social referents (‘neighbor,’ ‘leader,’ ‘father’) influence participants’ perceptions of aspects of livestock management. More senior social referents and ‘high’ standard norms were associated with greater impact on perceived importance of livestock management behaviors. Age also had an effect, with higher perceived importance and greater effect of norm treatment in younger respondents.

Environmental market design for large-scale marine conservation,Multiple (10 country model),"It is commonly agreed that marine conservation should expand considerably around the world. However, most countries have not yet implemented large-scale no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). When a country closes a large fraction of its waters to fishing, it stands to lose a considerable level of fishery revenue. Although biodiversity and spillover fishing benefits may far exceed these losses, benefits from large-scale MPAs typically accrue to other countries or to the high seas. Here, to overcome this dilemma, we simulate and test an international fisheries management scheme with transferable fishing rights that incentivizes, rather than hinders, large-scale marine conservation. By combining a bioeconomic model of cross-country trading of fishing rights with vessel-level tracking data before and after a large-scale conservation action is implemented, we show that transferable fishing rights and a biomass-based allocation rule are pivotal to incentivize conservation under this market-based setting. Our work focuses on the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS)—an environmental market that is employed by the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (a group of nine Pacific Island nations) to manage their tuna fisheries—and areas in which large-scale conservation interventions have taken place. Overall, these results provide a template for how to incentivize countries to engage in large-scale marine conservation within a market-based setting.

"Can Catch Shares Prevent Fisheries Collapse?","Multi-countries, 121 fisheries managed using catch shares (ITQ) ","Recent reports suggest that most of the world's commercial fisheries could collapse within decades. Although poor fisheries governance is often implicated, evaluation of solutions remains rare. Bioeconomic theory and case studies suggest that rights-based catch shares can provide individual incentives for sustainable harvest that is less prone to collapse. To test whether catch-share fishery reforms achieve these hypothetical benefits, we have compiled a global database of fisheries institutions and catch statistics in 11,135 fisheries from 1950 to 2003. Implementation of catch shares halts, and even reverses, the global trend toward widespread collapse. Institutional change has the potential for greatly altering the future of global fisheries.

Assessing the effects of payments for ecosystem services programs on forest structure and species biodiversity,China,"Globally, biodiversity has declined at an unprecedented rate, challenging the viability of ecosystems, species, and ecological functions and their corresponding services. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs have been established and implemented worldwide to combat the degradation or loss of essential ecosystems and ecosystem services without sacrificing the well-being of people. With an overarching goal of reducing soil erosion, China’s Grain-to-Green program (GTGP) converts cropland to forest or grassland. As one of the largest PES programs in the world, GTGP has great potential to offer biodiversity conservation co-benefits. To consider how GTGP may influence biodiversity, we measured forest structure and plant and wildlife species diversity at both GTGP forest and natural forest sites in Fangjingshan National Nature Reserve, China. We also evaluated the relationship between canopy cover and biodiversity measures to test whether forest cover, the most commonly measured and reported ecological metric of PES programs, might act as a good proxy for other biodiversity related parameters. We found that forest cover and species diversity increased after GTGP implementation as understory and overstory plant cover, and understory and midstory plant diversity at GTGP sites were similar to natural forest. Our results suggest that GTGP may also have been associated with increased habitat for protected and vulnerable wildlife species including Elliot’s pheasant (Syrmaticus ellioti), hog badger (Arctonyx collaris), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Nevertheless, we identified key differences between GTGP forest and natural forest, particularly variation in forest types and heterogeneity of overstory vegetation. As a result, plant overstory diversity and wildlife species richness at GTGP forest were significantly lower than at natural forest. Our findings suggest, while forest cover may be a good proxy for some metrics of forest structure, it does not serve as a robust proxy for many biodiversity parameters. These findings highlight the need for and importance of robust and representative indicators or proxy variables for measuring ecological effects of PES programs on compositional and structural diversity. We demonstrate that PES may lead to biodiversity co-benefits, but changes in program implementation could improve the return on investment of PES programs to support conservation of biodiversity.

Fisheries subsidies reform in China,China,"Subsidies are widely criticized in fisheries management for promoting global fishing capacity growth and overharvesting. Scientists worldwide have thus called for a ban on “harmful” subsidies that artificially increase fishing profits, resulting in the recent agreement among members of the World Trade Organization to eliminate such subsidies. The argument for banning harmful subsidies relies on the assumption that fishing will be unprofitable after eliminating subsidies, incentivizing some fishermen to exit and others to refrain from entering. These arguments follow from open-access governance regimes where entry has driven profits to zero. Yet many modern-day fisheries are conducted under limited-access regimes that limit capacity and maintain economic profits, even without subsidies. In these settings, subsidy removal will reduce profits but perhaps without any discernable effect on capacity. Importantly, until now, there have been no empirical studies of subsidy reductions to inform us about their likely quantitative impacts. In this paper, we evaluate a policy reform that reduced fisheries subsidies in China. We find that China’s subsidy reductions accelerated the rate at which fishermen retired their vessels, resulting in reduced fleet capacity, particularly among older and smaller vessels. Notably, the reduction of harmful subsidies was only partly responsible for reducing fleet capacity; an increase in vessel retirement subsidies was also a necessary driver of capacity reduction. Our study demonstrates that the efficacy of removing harmful subsidies depends on the policy environment in which removals occur.","TARGET 10: Enhance Biodiversity and Sustainability in Agriculture, Aquaculture, Fisheries, and Forestry

Do forest-management plans and FSC certification help avoid deforestation in the Congo Basin?,"Congo Basin, Central Africa (multi countries)","To allow for the production of timber while preserving conservation values, forestry regulations in the Congo Basin have made Forest Management Plans (FMP) mandatory in logging concessions. This paper uses original high-resolution maps of forest-cover changes and official records on the activities of logging concessions to analyze the impact of FMP on deforestation in this region. We apply quasi-experimental and difference-in-difference approaches to evaluate the change in deforestation in concessions managed under an approved FMP. We find that between 2000 and 2010, deforestation was 74% lower in concessions with an FMP compared to others. Building on a theory of change, further analyses revealed that this decrease in deforestation takes time to occur and is highest around communities located in and nearby logging concessions, and in areas close to previous deforestation. These findings suggest that FMP help avoid deforestation by allowing logging companies to rotate cycles of timber extraction, thereby avoiding the overexploitation of areas that were previously logged, and by the better regulation of access to concessions by closing former logging roads to limit illegal activities such as shifting agriculture, hunting and the illegal harvest of timber or fuel-wood.","TARGET 10: Enhance Biodiversity and Sustainability in Agriculture, Aquaculture, Fisheries, and Forestry

"The ecological outcomes of biodiversity offsets under “no net loss” policies: A global review
",Multiple,"No net loss (NNL) biodiversity policies mandating the application of a mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, remediate, offset) to the ecological impacts of built infrastructure are proliferating globally. However, little is known about their effectiveness at achieving NNL outcomes. We reviewed the English-language peer-reviewed literature (capturing 15,715 articles), and identified 32 reports that observed ecological outcomes from NNL policies, including >300,000 ha of biodiversity offsets. Approximately one-third of NNL policies and individual biodiversity offsets reported achieving NNL, primarily in wetlands, although most studies used widely criticized area-based outcome measures. The most commonly cited reason for success was applying high offset multipliers (large offset area relative to the impacted area). We identified large gaps between the global implementation of offsets and the evidence for their effectiveness: despite two-thirds of the world's biodiversity offsets being applied in forested ecosystems, we found none of four studies demonstrated successful NNL outcomes for forested habitats or species. We also found no evidence for NNL achievement using avoided loss offsets (impacts offset by protecting existing habitat elsewhere). Additionally, we summarized regional variability in compliance rates with NNL policies. As global infrastructural expansion accelerates, we must urgently improve the evidence-base around efforts to mitigate development impacts on biodiversity.

A cascade of events followed, including successful federal enforcement action against SeaWorld for employee safety violations. In 2012 and 2015, nonfiction books about SeaWorld's history with orcas were published; however, the 2013 documentary Blackfish has done the most to raise public awareness of captive orca welfare and trainer safety. It spawned a massive social media response, leading to the so-called ""Blackfish Effect."" SeaWorld's visitor numbers declined, business partners ended their relationships, and stock price plummeted. In 2012, Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta applied for a permit to import 18 wild-caught beluga whales from Russia; the permit was denied in 2013, the first time a public display permit had ever been denied in the history of the US Marine Mammal Protection Act. In 2014 and 2016, the California legislature considered bills phasing out captive orca exhibits in the state; the 2016 bill passed and became law in January 2017. In November 2015, a similar bill was introduced (and reintroduced in March 2017) in the US House of Representatives. In March 2016 SeaWorld announced it would end its orca breeding program company-wide and in January 2018 the Vancouver Aquarium announced it would no longer display cetaceans.

The USAID Wildlife Asia Activity, implemented from 2016 to 2022, pioneered the use of social and behavior change communication (SBCC) as an approach to reduce the consumer demand making up part of the multibillion-dollar trade in illegal wildlife products. SBCC demand reduction efforts complemented USAID Wildlife Asia’s supply-side disruption activities as a holistic approach towards counter wildlife trafficking (CWT). Applying SBCC principles, USAID Wildlife Asia campaigns targeted current and potential consumers, rather than the general public, and promoted messaging to counter the drivers underlying demand for these products. The review assesses the factors that contributed to the success of these campaigns, the challenges faced, actions taken, and lessons learned. It provides insights and recommendations for future SBCC demand reduction campaigns and shows the benefits of the SBCC approach.

"A Take-Home Message: Workplace Food Waste Interventions Influence Household Pro-environmental Behaviors
",China,"Previous research on food waste interventions has mostly focused on micro-level factors related to the individuals, and largely neglected macro-level contextual factors such as work-to-home spillovers. Inspired by the multi-level framework, we present a case study of how macro-level workplace campaigns could decrease food waste in staff cafeterias, compete with micro-level factors like environmental identity, and further stimulate some employees’ food saving efforts at home. The workplace interventions combined smart bins with fortnightly informational feedback trialed in three staff cafeterias of a large hotel chain in Macau, China. Actual food waste data and self-reported behavior consistently show that the staff cafeteria receiving environmental framing with anthropomorphic cues had more reductions in food waste behaviors. A key determinant of self-reported food saving efforts at home was efforts to reduce food waste at work, which predicted beyond and above environmental identity and provided evidence for positive contextual spillover effects.

Reducing Plastic Waste by Visualizing Marine Consequences,Canada,"Plastic pollution has become a major global conservation challenge. To reduce the generation of plastic waste, we designed and tested several behavioral interventions in a randomized control trial to reduce plastic waste in a high-rise office building. We randomly assigned eight floors in the building to four conditions: (1) simplified recycling signage, (2) signage with a marine animal trapped in plastic debris, (3) signage with a pledge that invited people to be plastic wise to protect ocean life, and (4) control. We found that the signage with the animal reduced plastic waste by 17%, the largest effect among the other conditions. After implementing the signage to the entire building, we found an overall reduction in plastic waste over 6 weeks. The current study demonstrates the effectiveness of visualizing marine consequences of plastic waste and provides a behavioral solution connecting disposal actions and the Downstream consequences for plastic waste reduction.

"Impact of increasing vegetarian availability on meal selection and sales in cafeterias
",UK,"Shifting people in higher income countries toward more plant-based diets would protect the natural environment and improve population health. Research in other domains suggests altering the physical environments in which people make decisions (“nudging”) holds promise for achieving socially desirable behavior change. Here, we examine the impact of attempting to nudge meal selection by increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals offered in a year-long large-scale series of observational and experimental field studies. Anonymized individual-level data from 94,644 meals purchased in 2017 were collected from 3 cafeterias at an English university. Doubling the proportion of vegetarian meals available from 25 to 50% (e.g., from 1 in 4 to 2 in 4 options) increased vegetarian meal sales (and decreased meat meal sales) by 14.9 and 14.5 percentage points in the observational study (2 cafeterias) and by 7.8 percentage points in the experimental study (1 cafeteria), equivalent to proportional increases in vegetarian meal sales of 61.8%, 78.8%, and 40.8%, respectively. Linking sales data to participants’ previous meal purchases revealed that the largest effects were found in the quartile of diners with the lowest prior levels of vegetarian meal selection. Moreover, serving more vegetarian options had little impact on overall sales and did not lead to detectable rebound effects: Vegetarian sales were not lower at other mealtimes. These results provide robust evidence to support the potential for simple changes to catering practices to make an important contribution to achieving more sustainable diets at the population level.",TARGET 16: Enable Sustainable Consumption Choices To Reduce Waste and Overconsumption,Downstream,Students in 3 colleges at the University of Cambridge,Changing the default option,Doubled the proportion of vegetarian meals offered in cafeterias to nudge selection towards more plant-based options without restricting diners' choices.,,"TARGET 10: Enhance Biodiversity and Sustainability in Agriculture, Aquaculture, Fisheries, and Forestry",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1907207116,,Yes
"Reducing single-use cutlery with green nudges: Evidence from China’s food-delivery industry
",China,"Rising consumer demand for online food delivery has increased the consumption of disposable cutlery, leading to plastic pollution worldwide. In this work, we investigate the impact of green nudges on single-use cutlery consumption in China. In collaboration with Alibaba’s food-delivery platform, Eleme (which is similar to Uber Eats and DoorDash), we analyzed detailed customer-level data and found that the green nudges—changing the default to “no cutlery” and rewarding consumers with “green points”—increased the share of no-cutlery orders by 648%. The environmental benefits are sizable: If green nudges were applied to all of China, more than 21.75 billion sets of single-use cutlery could be saved annually, equivalent to preventing the generation of 3.26 million metric tons of plastic waste and saving 5.44 million trees.

"Randomised controlled trial of a text messaging intervention for reducing processed meat consumption: The mediating roles of anticipated regret and intention
",Italy,"The present study aimed to extend the literature on text messaging interventions involved in promoting healthy eating behaviours. The theoretical framework was the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). A randomized controlled trial was used to test the impact of daily text messages compared to no message (groups) for reducing processed meat consumption (PMC) over a 2 week period, testing the sequential mediation role of anticipated regret and intention on the relationship between groups and PMC reduction. PMC and TPB variables were assessed both at Time 1 and Time 2. Participants were Italian undergraduates (at Time 1 N = 124) randomly allocated to control and message condition groups. Undergraduates in the message condition group received a daily SMS, which focused on anticipated regret and urged them to self-monitor PMC. Participants in the control group did not receive any message. Those who completed all measures at both time points were included in the analyses (N = 112). Findings showed that a daily messaging intervention, controlling for participants’ past behaviour, reduced self-reported consumption of PMC. Mediation analyses indicated partial serial mediation via anticipated regret and intentions. The current study provided support for the efficacy of a daily messaging intervention targeting anticipated regret and encouraging self-monitoring in decreasing PMC. Outcomes showed the important mediating role of anticipated regret and intentions for reducing PMC.

"Incentives for climate mitigation in the land use sector—the effects of payment for environmental services on environmental and socioeconomic outcomes in low- and middle-income countries: A mixed-methods systematic review
","Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia and Pacific, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa","Unsustainable practices in the land use sector contribute to climate change through the release of greenhouse gases. Payment for environmental services (PESs) provide economic incentives to reduce the negative environmental impacts of land use and are a popular approach to mitigate climate change in low- and middle-income countries. Some PES programmes also aim to improve socioeconomic outcomes and reduce poverty. This systematic review examines the effect of programmes on environmental and socioeconomic outcomes. We identified 44 quantitative impact evaluations and 60 qualitative studies of PES programmes for inclusion in the review, to assess both the effects of PES and identify context, design and implementation features that may influence PES effectiveness. The studies covered 18 programmes from 12 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia and Pacific, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The review finds that PES may increase household income, reduce deforestation and improve forest cover, but the findings are, however, based on low and very low quality evidence from a small number of programmes and should be treated with caution. Qualitative evidence indicates that several factors influence whether PES programmes are likely to be effective in different contexts and suggests that the inclusion of strong governance structures and the effective targeting of both locations and participants may improve intervention effectiveness. Funders, implementing agencies and researchers should collaborate to develop a coordinated programme of rigorous, mixed-methods impact evaluation implemented across contexts. Until such evidence is available, PES programmes remain a high-risk strategy for climate change mitigation.

"Conservation fundraising: Evidence from social media and traditional mail field experiments
",Japan,"Funding shortages limit conservation impact, making it vital to find effective fundraising methods. To explore how traditional and digital conservation fundraising methods perform, we conducted real-world field experiments by using direct-mail and Facebook advertisements. We compared three types of message frames (simple, seed money, and ecological). We found that the seed money frame, which emphasizes the amount already donated, increased the number of donors, whereas the ecological frame, which focuses on the fact that the fundraiser benefits threatened species, led to a relative reduction in the number of donors. We also found that while Facebook advertising costs exceeded donations, while the opposite was true for the traditional mail experiment. This highlights the importance of identifying appropriate donor pools for online and offline fundraising before implementing campaigns. Our findings illustrate some challenges associated with online fundraising and the importance of behavioral evidence to enhance effective fundraising in conservation.

In addition to this, a subset of subjects was offered public recognition alongside videos. We found media content influences pro-social behaviour on both the intensive and extensive margins of giving: videos with charismatic Lions increased the probability of donating (intensive margin of giving), but content about human cause of endangerment, increased the amount donated conditional on having decided to donate (extensive margin of giving). There is heterogeneity in treatment effects based on past pro-social behaviour: public recognition increases donations only for those reporting donating to charities in the past.

"Snowchange, Linnunsuo (Finland)",Finland,"In Finland, the integration of traditional knowledge and scientific research has become a cornerstone of environmental conservation efforts. This approach emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between the Sámi people and their environment, recognizing the value of their traditional practices in maintaining ecological balance and promoting biodiversity. The Sámi, an Indigenous people residing in the northern parts of Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Russia, have a long history of sustainable land use and natural resource management. Their knowledge, passed down through generations, includes intricate details about local ecosystems, wildlife behaviour, and seasonal cycles. This deep understanding is now being harnessed to guide modern conservation strategies and ensure that development projects do not harm the delicate balance of these ecosystems. One significant initiative is the Snowchange Cooperative, which collaborates with Sámi communities to document and revive traditional practices. This includes reindeer herding, fishing, and berry picking, all of which contribute to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The cooperative also engages in climate change research, drawing on Sámi knowledge to monitor environmental changes and develop adaptive strategies. The integration of traditional knowledge has proven beneficial in various ways. For instance, Sámi reindeer herders have identified changes in grazing patterns and the availability of lichen, a crucial winter food source for reindeer, which are linked to climate change. This information has been invaluable for scientists studying the impacts of global warming on Arctic ecosystems. Additionally, the collaboration has led to practical conservation outcomes, such as the restoration of degraded wetlands and the protection of vital habitats. The success of these projects highlights the importance of respecting and incorporating Indigenous perspectives in environmental management, ensuring that conservation efforts are culturally sensitive and ecologically effective. Overall, the Finnish model demonstrates how blending traditional knowledge with scientific research can enhance environmental protection, support Indigenous rights, and promote sustainable development.

TCE’s goal is to help people increase their knowledge of their environment and develop more positive habits and behaviours towards their local environment, especially the Critically Endangered and endemic crested macaques (Macaca nigra). We measured the efficacy of TCE’s programme for pupils using questionnaires provided one month before and one month after a year-long conservation education programme at school. Pupils’ knowledge and behaviour scores increased significantly after their participation in the programme. Their habits score also increased but this increase was not statistically significant. Girls scored significantly higher than boys in terms of positive behaviour towards wildlife. Children participating in the programme more than once seemed to obtain higher scores in their second participation, although the sample size was too small for formal analysis.

"Stepping into the Wildeverse: Evaluating the impact of augmented reality mobile gaming on pro-conservation behaviours
",UK,"Promoting pro-conservation behaviours has become a priority for conservation organisations world-wide. Yet, current engagement strategies still face a number of barriers to creating successful interventions at the scale needed to meet global sustainability challenges. Online and mobile games enjoy immense world-wide popularity, tapping into an audience not normally reached through conventional conservation outreach channels. Despite this potential to be a new, high impact and scalable platform for promoting pro-environmental behaviours, the opportunities within digital games for conservation have thus far been little explored and organisations have called for robust impact evaluations for this medium. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of the augmented reality game Wildeverse, which seeks to generate support for ape conservation and encourage pro-environmental behaviours. We conducted a randomised control trial to experimentally compare the impacts of this game against watching a documentary, a conventional conservation outreach intervention. We compared changes in participants' knowledge, attitudes and revealed donation behaviours across the two groups and found that games performed as well as documentaries in supporting positive environmental knowledge and attitudes.The results gathered from this study provide experimental insight into the potential for the broader use of digital games for conservation outreach and also provide evidence against the argument that gaming can detract from real-world environmental problems creating a disconnect with these issues. However, results from this study could not provide any evidence that Wildeverse was successful in achieving its additional aim of encouraging players to donate to conservation, which provides evidence for the existence of an environmental values–behaviour gap in conservation gaming. The gaming industry is global and rapidly growing and should no longer be ignored as an avenue for conservation outreach.

",USA,"Encouraging people to share science-based information on environmental issues with others is critical for enhancing the speed and scale of conservation action. However, little experimental research exists that examines how message framing can facilitate the social diffusion of scientific information. We report the results of a series of studies conducted to test the effects of normative and efficacy-based messaging on Colorado residents' willingness to share scientific information about the state's wolf reintroduction initiative. We distributed messaging using mailings to the general public, surveys of online participant panels, and personal messages from undergraduate students to their own contacts. We then measured participants' individual engagement with the scientific information we provided and their engagement in social behaviors that would encourage further social diffusion of the information. While we find some evidence of increased engagement by people contacted through social diffusion, we do not find any evidence that normative and efficacy-based messaging encourages people to engage in social diffusion, nor do we find that such messaging enhances individual engagement with the scientific information. We identify several barriers to the sharing of scientific information, which could inform the development of future interventions to scale up biodiversity conservation efforts beyond individual engagement through widespread social diffusion.

We found that after the Field School program, participants were significantly more knowledgeable about environmental issues, more connected to nature, showed greater intentions and willingness to engage in sustainability actions compared to garden visitors from the general public who did not go through the program. The results suggest that interactive sustainability education in a botanical garden setting can be a useful education model to mobilize public engagement on sustainability.

Evaluating bundles of interventions to prevent peat-fires (Indonesia),Indonesia,"The carbon-dense peatlands of Indonesia are a landscape of global importance undergoing rapid land-use change. Here, peat drained for agricultural expansion increases the risk of large-scale uncontrolled fires. Several solutions to this complex environmental, humanitarian and economic crisis have been proposed, such as forest protection measures and agricultural support. However, numerous programmes have largely failed. Bundles of interventions are proposed as promising strategies in integrated approaches, but what policy interventions to combine and how to align such bundles to local conditions remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of two types of interventions and of their combinations, in reducing fire occurrence through driving behavioural change: incentives (i.e. rewards that are conditional on environmental performance), and deterrents (e.g. sanction, soliciting concerns for health). We look at the impact of these interventions in 10 villages with varying landscape and fire-risk contexts in Sumatra, Indonesia. A private-led implementation of a standardised programme allows us to study outcome variability through a natural experiment design. We conduct a systematic cross-case comparison to identify the most effective combinations of interventions, using two-step qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and geospatial and socio-economic survey data (n = 303). We analysed the combined influence of proximate conditions (interventions, e.g. fear of sanction) and remote ones (context; e.g. extent of peat soil) on fire outcomes. We show how, depending on the level of risk in the pre-existing context, certain bundles of interventions are needed to succeed. We found that, despite the programme being framed as rewards-based, people were not responding to the reward alone. Rather sanctions and soliciting concern appeared central to fire prevention, raising important equity implications. Our results contribute to the emerging global interest in peat fire mitigation, and the rapidly developing literature on PES performance.

Kope Lion (Tanzania),Tanzania,"In Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), human-lion conflict is a critical issue, causing annual livestock losses estimated at $30,000. These losses severely affect residents who depend on livestock for their livelihoods, exacerbating poverty and leading to retaliatory lion killings. This conflict has isolated the Ngorongoro Crater lion population from the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem (GSE). To mitigate these conflicts, reducing the economic burden of lion depredation on local communities is essential. Traditional compensation schemes, reimbursing livestock losses, have had limited success due to issues like fraud, moral hazard, high transaction costs, delays, and lack of trust. An alternative approach is incentive-based schemes, or conservation incentive payments (CIPs), which directly reward stakeholders for conservation actions or outcomes, ensuring payments are conditional on meeting specific criteria. In 2017, a feasibility study explored establishing a lion CIP program in the NCA, revealing strong stakeholder support and a legal pathway for implementation. A workshop in 2018, involving key stakeholders, outlined the program's framework. In October 2020, a three-year pilot program was launched, rewarding villages based on the number of unique lions observed using GPS collar data and direct observations. Villages used CIP earnings, disbursed upon receipt of valid budget plans, for community projects. Over the pilot, Misigiyo and Ngorongoro wards earned ~$35,000 each, more than doubling the value of livestock lost to lions. Most earnings were eventually directed towards education, funding school desks for over 650 students and sending 215 needy students to secondary school. A 2023 survey and focus groups post-pilot indicated high awareness (92%) and approval (93%) of the CIP program, with respondents more likely to view lions positively and less likely to support retaliatory killings. Only one lion killing occurred in the pilot wards, deemed self-defence. Key lessons include the need for community capacity to manage earnings and a relevant, feasible earnings framework. Success hinges on substantial trust and communication, supported by a history of collaboration. Long-term funding is crucial for sustainability, with benefits to all stakeholders from making wildlife conservation financially advantageous for local communities.

Developing a community guardian programme to reduce livestock depredation - Long Shields Lion Guardian Programme (Zimbabwe and Botswana),Zimbabwe and Botswana,"The case study focuses on the Trans-Kalahari Predator Programme (TKPP), part of Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, aiming to reduce human-wildlife conflict, particularly livestock depredation, near Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. The TKPP developed a community guardian program called the Long Shields Lion Guardian Programme (LSLGP). Local men and women were recruited to serve as guardians and protect livestock from predators. They used GPS collars on potential problem lions, alerting farmers via WhatsApp to move their livestock when lions approached. The guardians also hazed lions using noise makers. Additionally, the TKPP introduced mobile communal bomas to protect livestock and fertilise crop fields. The LSLGP resulted in a 50% reduction in livestock losses by lions, and fewer lions were killed in retaliation. Crop yields in fields with mobile bomas increased by up to 50%, improving food security. Local communities showed a positive attitude towards coexisting with lions and were willing to pay for the programs. Lessons learned include the importance of local researchers, communication, community involvement, and flexibility in implementation.

Building institutional and local community capacity to manage human-wildlife conflict (Mozambique),Mozambique,"This case study comes from Mozambique, where human-wildlife conflict was not a new issue in 2010. Incidents had been increasing, particularly those involving crocodiles Crocodylus niloticus, elephants Loxodonta africana, and lions Panthera leo. These incidents impacted food security, local community incomes, well-being and safety, and were exacerbated by poverty levels. Human-wildlife conflict had become a major concern for the Government of Mozambique and led them to formulate a National Strategy for Human-Wildlife Conflict Management (2009-2014). The government approved the Strategy in 2009, and from 2010 its implementation was supported by FAO, through a Technical Cooperation Programme Project The FAO project's objective was to design an implementation plan for the Strategy with the expressed goal of mitigating human-wildlife conflicts and build the needed capacity in the country to be able to do so. This case study focuses on how capacity was built in Mozambique to implement the Strategy. By building capacity in the national government agencies, the FAO project empowered the government agencies to guide and implement the country's national strategy on human-wildlife conflict. The overhauled database, covering five years (2006-2010), was presented at the Council of Ministers, in order to underscore the importance of the situation in Mozambique, inform the Ministers of the problem, and highlight some of the tools available to reduce the impacts of human-wildlife conflict, particularly the crocodile cages that had been used and improved.

Mali Elephant Project - Using traditional governance systems to manage competition over natural resources (Mali),Mali,"This case study covers the Gourma region of Mali, south of Timbuktu, where a small population of approximately 350 “desert-adapted” African elephants Loxodonta africana undertake an annual migration circuit spanning over 32 000 square km driven by the widely dispersed natural resources in the region. Their migration primarily responds to the availability of water, food and refuge throughout the year, while avoiding areas of high human activity. Started in 2006, following three years of scientific studies the Mali Elephant Project sought to understand the threats to the elephants as arising from the multiple relationships within the social-ecological system, and then try to shift key factors affecting those relationships so the net result would be a reduction in threat for both humans and wildlife. This case study outlines how this approach translated into action.

Alexander Archipelago Wolf,USA,"The United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska, USA, conducted a species status assessment for a petition to list the Alexander Archipelago wolf (Canis lupus ligoni) under the Endangered Species Act in 2020-2022. This federal undertaking could not be adequately prepared without including the knowledge of Indigenous People who have a deep cultural connection with the subspecies. Our objective is to communicate the authoritative expertise and voice of the Indigenous People who partnered on the project by demonstrating how their knowledge contributed to the species status assessment. The Indigenous knowledge applied in the assessment is the cultural and intellectual property of those who have shared it. We employed rapid appraisal research to expeditiously develop a preliminary and qualitative understanding of Indigenous People's cultural and ecological knowledge of Alexander Archipelago wolves. We used semi-directed interviewing and inductive coding from grounded theory for text analysis. Indigenous knowledge contributed to the agency's understanding of the Alexander Archipelago wolf in Southeast Alaska and helped the agency with their classification decision. Indigenous research partners explained the rich cultural significance and position of wolves in Tlingit society and described human–wolf relationships and ecological interactions. The agency used a single-species assessment approach based in species ecology and conservation biology, whereas the Indigenous wolf experts applied a multi-species, community ecology approach based in a sociocultural context of balance and respect. The Indigenous wolf experts successfully addressed knowledge gaps identified by the agency. The partners were challenged by a short regulatory timeframe that did not allow for comprehensive study of Indigenous knowledge and constrained review and feedback by Indigenous experts. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service learned that its assessment framework was not designed to account for an Indigenous worldview. To level the playing field, the agency and Indigenous experts should discuss how to co-develop an assessment framework that equitably applies both perspectives.

LIFE MEDWOLF,Italy,"Wolves in Europe are expanding their range and significantly impacting farming livelihoods and landscapes. Damage prevention measures such as livestock guarding dogs and night-time enclosures have proven successful in mitigating losses. However, they are often implemented as top-down measures without a proper understanding of the farming dynamics they are meant to alter, making them unappealing and difficult to implement for farmers. Semi-extensive, small scale livestock farming systems are particularly vulnerable and diverse, requiring specific care and catered support when addressing issues related to wildlife management. In these contexts, it is crucial to employ adaptive management approaches that enable solutions to be collaboratively designed at the grassroots level. Here we propose a method for centring the experiences and knowledge of local farmers to co-produce damage prevention practices that better address their needs. We developed this approach in the course of the LIFE MEDWOLF project, which was implemented in the province of Grosseto, Italy, between 2012 and 2017. The project brought together local authorities, environmental associations, farming unions and individual farmers to develop tailor-made damage prevention measures and assess their technical and economic impact, through a stepwise process. Collaboration with 86 local farmers resulted in >50 modifications to the original project plan, and an overall 50% reduction of preyed livestock in farms that participated in the project. Our findings highlight the benefits of collaboratively designing, implementing, and monitoring damage prevention measures with farmers. Based on these results, we reflect on the importance of integrating local and scientific knowledge, on the implications this has had on stakeholder relations, and on the challenges that we faced in upscaling this management approach.

Lora parrot conservation,"Kingdom of the Netherlands (Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba, Caribbean)","Social marketing campaigns use marketing techniques to influence human behavior for the greater social good. In the conservation sector, social marketing campaigns have been used to influence behavior for the benefit of biodiversity as well as society. However, there are few evaluations of their effectiveness. We devised an approach for evaluating the influences of social marketing campaigns on human behavior and conservation outcomes. We used general elimination methodology, a theory-driven qualitative evaluation method, to assess the long-term impacts of a 1998 Rare Pride campaign on the island of Bonaire that was designed to increase the population of the Lora (Amazona barbadensis), a threatened parrot. We interviewed stakeholder groups to determine their perceptions of the drivers of the changes in the Lora population over time. We used these data to develop an overall theory of change to explain changes in the Lora population by looking at the overlap in hypotheses within and between stakeholder groups. We then triangulated that theory of change with evidence from government reports, peer-reviewed literature, and newspapers. The increase in the Lora population was largely attributed to a decrease in illegal poaching of Loras and an associated decrease in local demand for pet Loras. Decreases in poaching and demand were likely driven by a combination of law enforcement, social marketing (including the Rare campaign), and environmental education in schools. General elimination methodology helped show how multiple interventions influenced a conservation outcome over time. There is a need for evidence-based evaluations of social marketing interventions to ensure that limited resources are spent wisely.

The Elephant Queen: Can a nature documentary help to increase tolerance towards elephants?,Kenya,"Conflict between humans and elephants is one of the more complex examples of human-wildlife conflict, a key challenge for wildlife conservation. While interventions exist to separate humans from elephants, few exist aimed at bringing the two species closer together. This study assesses if a natural history film, The Elephant Queen (TEQ), makes communities living around elephants more tolerant of conflict with elephants. Questionnaires and interviews were conducted before and after seeing the film screened on a mobile cinema in Southern Kenya. A double robust ordinal regression analysis using 357 matching specifications to measure the effect size of viewing TEQ on the six criteria identified as being drivers of tolerance of a wild animal by the Hazard Acceptance model.
This study found that students aged between 16 and 18 gained knowledge (mean effect size = 0.27) and affection (mean effect size = 0.17) towards elephants and felt the benefits of elephants more keenly (mean effect size = 0.26) following viewing TEQ. Community members aged between 16–80 also gained knowledge (mean effect size = 0.21) and saw the benefits of elephants (mean effect size = 0.15) but felt the costs of living with elephants more profoundly after viewing TEQ (mean effect size = −0.11). After 90 days a follow-up survey also showed a significant increase in community “affection” towards elephants (mean effect size = 0.11), however the costs, benefits and knowledge gained had been reduced to a statistically insignificant level compared to baseline. Our results suggest that natural history films can serve as a valuable tool in inspiring young minds.

"The impact of perceived threat and perceived coping efficacy on individual actions toward biodiversity conservation: a registered report
",UK,"Biodiversity has decreased drastically over the last decades, posing an existential threat to all life on earth. Addressing this threat requires urgent actions to conserve biodiversity including changing the behavior of individuals to reduce their impacts on biodiversity. In the present research, we applied an emotion-based persuasion appeal model to biodiversity conservation, based on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), to examine how behavioral change can be best communicated and promoted. We tested the predictions of the EPPM that perceived threat (and related increases in fear) as well as coping efficacy (and related increases in optimism) interactively contribute to fostering behavioral change towards biodiversity conservation. To that end, we conducted an online experiment (N = 510) where participants read a text on the threatened status of bumblebees, a concrete example of the broader challenge of protecting ecosystems and wildlife, and subsequently performed a task where they could earn money to spend for the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. Results revealed no evidence for the assumptions of the EPPM, as neither manipulating perceived threat nor coping efficacy appraisal nor their interaction impacted consequential conservation behavior or self-reported conservation intention.

"Evaluation of interventions focused on reducing propeller scarring by recreational boaters in Florida, USA
",USA,"Propeller scarring by recreational vessels is a known threat to seagrass meadows in Florida. Despite decades of awareness about the problem, there has been little meaningful progress in addressing this largely preventable stressor. We consider it preventable because it rests on human behaviors, which can be changed by education, technology, social norms, and policy. However, past attempts to address seagrass scarring have rarely been evaluated for effectiveness. Thus, very little guidance exists for natural resource managers, educators, and policy makers responsible for allocating limited resources toward effective interventions. Using a social marketing approach, we deployed two separate interventions, one education-based and the other cue-based (navigational aids) in Florida, USA. We measured boater behavior and attitudes before and after the interventions to assess the relative effectiveness of each. Navigational aids elicited a clear behavioral improvement across a broad cross-section of boaters, while minimal effects were observed for the educational intervention. However, analyses suggest the recreational boating audience can be segmented by factors such as experience level to better target educational messages in future seagrass protection efforts. These results will assist seagrass managers, educators, advocates, policy makers, and boating industry stakeholders in deploying an efficient combination of approaches to better address propeller scarring in Florida's seagrass meadows.

"Reducing the threat of wildlife-vehicle collisions during peak tourism periods using a Roadside Animal Detection System
",USA,"Roadside Animal Detection Systems (RADS) aim to reduce the frequency of wildlife-vehicle collisions. Unlike fencing and wildlife passages, RADS do not attempt to keep animals off the road; rather, they attempt to modify driver behavior by detecting animals near the road and warning drivers with flashing signs. A RADS was installed in Big Cypress National Park (Florida, USA) in 2012 in response to an increased number of Florida panther mortalities. To assess driver response, we measured the speed of individual cars on the road when the RADS was active (flashing) and inactive (not flashing) during the tourist season (November–March) and the off-season (April–October), which vary dramatically in traffic volume. We also used track beds and camera traps to assess whether roadside activity of large mammal species varied between seasons. In the tourist season, the activation of the RADS caused a significant reduction in vehicle speed. However, this effect was not observed in the off-season. Track and camera data showed that the tourist season coincided with peak periods of activity for several large mammals of conservation interest. Drivers in the tourist season generally drove faster than those in the off-season, so a reduction in speed in response to the RADS is more beneficial in the tourist season. Because traffic volume and roadside activity of several species of conservation interest both peak during the tourist season, our study indicates that the RADS has the potential to reduce the number of accidents during this period of heightened risk.

Pangolin Meat Consumption Falls in Cameroon as Support for Protection Rises,Cameroon,"This study reveals a significant decrease in pangolin meat consumption in urban Cameroon over the past two years, driven by increased awareness and support for a 2017 law banning the capture and killing of pangolins. Conducted by Cible Etudes & Conseil, a survey in five cities found that over 60% of urban Cameroonians are now aware of the legislation—more than double the 2022 figure—with two-thirds supporting pangolin protection. Following a 2022 awareness campaign led by prominent Cameroonian figures, the government has intensified law enforcement efforts. The study shows a 26.7% decline in regular pangolin meat consumption in key cities, despite slight increases in areas under strict post-pandemic controls. Additionally, public recognition of pangolins' ecological value and their endangered status has risen, indicating growing support for conservation.

"WildAid survey reveals Thailand’s shark fin consumption has declined by 34%, but demand for sharks persists",Thailand,"This study report on Shark Awareness Day reveals a 34% decline in shark fin consumption in Thailand over the past six years, equating to 8.1 million fewer servings annually. This decline, assessed through a 2023 survey of 1,007 urban Thais, shows a reduction in consumption from 23.9 million servings in 2017 to 15.7 million in 2023. Despite this, 56% of urban Thais remain interested in trying shark fin. The study highlights increased public awareness, with 88% now recognizing sharks' ecological importance, up from 68% in 2017. The decline in consumption is attributed to WildAid's 'Chalong Mai Chalarm' campaign and increased awareness of the negative impacts of shark fin trade.

WILDMEAT Interventions Database,"Multi-countries, 121 fisheries managed using catch shares (ITQ) ","The WILDMEAT Interventions Database provides a freely accessible, comprehensive database cataloguing past and current wild meat interventions that aim to increase the sustainability of wild meat use. Many interventions in the wild meat sector have been implemented worldwide, including in Central Africa (e.g., Wicander and Coad 2018). These may, for example, provide alternative livelihoods, improve hunting law enforcement and regulation, manage hunting at a community level, aim to reduce consumer demand through campaigns or awareness raising activities, or provide a mixture of some or all of these (see the Interventions Data Explorer ‘about’ section for more details of types of intervention). However, intervention details are often unpublished, therefore limiting available information on the number and distribution of such interventions, the stakeholders involved, and ultimately their progress towards conservation and development outcomes. This presents a vast knowledge gap for addressing unsustainable wild meat consumption and trade and hinders conservation researchers and practitioners from learning from the experiences of other projects. When designing and implementing future interventions, a thorough understanding of the wider intervention landscape is required to build upon previous successes and failures (van Velden et al. 2020). Interventions targeting wild meat use often involve limited resources, so addressing this knowledge gap will help focus critical resources on the most effective and evidence-based methods (Dobson et al. 2019).

A conciliatory and persuasive social campaign changes owner behavior to reduce cats' hunting,New Zealand,"Solutions to the cats-hunting-wildlife environmental conflict could benefit from social science approaches. Our Theory of Planned Behavior questionnaire—informed by an elicitation survey of cat owners at veterinary clinics about their attitudes, norms, and beliefs regarding bringing their cats inside at night—surveyed 158 cat owners across 20 veterinarian clinics in four cities. It revealed that wildlife conservation was not influential on cat owner intention but veterinarians, cat safety, peers, and household members were. Thus, we designed a social marketing campaign with two treatments: (1) a veterinarian/cat safety message or (2) social/family norm message. Thirty-four veterinary clinics received one of the two campaign posters or served as the control group. Customers (n = 510) received a “cat welfare” survey and then a pamphlet with the advocated message, and a follow-up survey by email or telephone 3–6 weeks later (69% response rate). Campaign messaging significantly increased the number of cat owners who reported bringing their cats inside at night compared to the control group. The social/family norm message was most effective. Although rudimentary, the campaign generated measurable changes in cat owner intention and behavior. Conservation campaigns informed by co-benefits for cat owners may reduce cats' hunting and be conciliatory ways of transcending environmental conflict.","TARGET 4: Halt Species Extinction, Protect Genetic Diversity, and Manage Human-Wildlife Conflicts

The roles of activist NGOs in the development and transformation of IWC regime: the interaction of norms and power.,"Japan, Norway, Iceland","The International Whaling Commission (IWC) was originally established as a regime to manage whaling under the norm of conservation for use. However, over time it was transformed into a regime to prohibit whaling, largely due to the anti-whaling campaigns that were mounted by activist nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that favored a norm of pure preservation. This resulted in an IWC decision to place a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982. In response to this decision, six whaling countries abandoned whaling under threat of US sanctions. In contrast, three countries, Japan, Norway, and Iceland, decided to continue whaling while their attitudes concerning the moratorium decision were rather passive or moderate when it was first introduced. Later, they became highly determined to continue whaling. In fact, they lead an upsurge in pro-whaling participants at the IWC, which is currently deadlocked between pro- and anti-whaling forces. This paper uses the concept of psychological reactance to better understand the behavior of pro-whaling countries in the face of considerable pressures from anti-whaling elements. We argue that the strong resistance of Japan, Norway, and Iceland to the whaling ban can be explained by the social and economic importance of whaling in each country combined with the different strategies adopted by the NGOs. Our results suggest that NGOs’ strategies vis-a-vis these countries were counterproductive and that persuasion, while more time-consuming and expensive, would have been more effective than pressure in the long run.","TARGET 4: Halt Species Extinction, Protect Genetic Diversity, and Manage Human-Wildlife Conflicts

Locally-appropriate conservation incentives for small-scale fishers (Indonesia),Indonesia,"Large, long-lived marine animals (‘marine megafauna’) are amongst the world's most threatened taxa, primarily due to overfishing. Reducing fisheries' impacts on marine megafauna is particularly challenging in small-scale fisheries (SSFs), where endangered species can have important consumptive use values. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have been proposed as a potential solution, but there is a lack of empirical data on if and how they might work in this context. We present a novel combination of methods – scenario interviews with contingent valuation (CV) – for exploring and designing locally-appropriate PES schemes; and apply these methods to investigate how different types of incentives might influence fisher behaviour and mortality of Critically Endangered taxa in two case study SSFs in Indonesia. Fishers almost unanimously supported positive conditional incentives: 98 % and 96 % of fishers would stop landing hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna spp.) and wedgefish (Rhynchobatus spp.), respectively, in contrast to 1 % and 6 % under a business-as-usual scenario, and 52 % and 46 % in response to a negative incentive (fine). CV results showed that an incentive-based scheme for catch mitigation of all hammerheads and wedgefish across both sites could cost US$71,408–235,927 annually, and save up to 18,500 and 2140 individuals, respectively. This study provides empirical evidence that PES could offer a cost-effective and socially-just approach for marine conservation in SSFs; and offers a scalable method for designing locally-appropriate investment-ready schemes, which could support the delivery of societal goals such as net positive outcomes for marine biodiversity and a sustainable and equitable blue economy.

"Combating the exotic pet trade: Effects of conservation messaging on attitudes, demands, and civic intentions (USA)
",USA,"The exotic pet trade poses a major threat to biodiversity conservation. To combat biodiversity loss, it is essential to reduce demand for exotic pets and engage people in civic actions for wildlife conservation. Although messaging has been extensively used in conservation practice, little is known about how it can influence attitudes and various types of actions pertaining to the exotic pet trade. This study examined the impact of conservation messaging in the context of exotic pet ownership and wildlife entertainment visitation as common practices of the exotic pet trade. We randomly assigned participants in the United States to one of five messaging conditions: biodiversity loss and animal abuse (M1), zoonotic disease risks (M2), illegality (M3), social disapproval (M4), and neutral biological information as a control condition (M5). We found that all conservation messages (M1–M4) significantly decreased people's favorable attitudes toward the exotic pet trade and their desire to visit wildlife entertainment. However, conservation messaging did not influence the desire for exotic pet ownership or intentions to take civic actions. Our findings highlight the potential of conservation messaging for attitude change and demand reduction for wildlife entertainment, but different approaches are necessary for promoting more effortful actions such as exotic pet ownership and civic actions.

We used surveys and randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of three types of messages, which were codesigned with key stakeholders, with 2496 potential consumers and nontarget consumers in China. We found a 23% decrease in intention among potential consumers to use wild animal medicinal products by health-related messages, and a 14% decrease by legality-related messages, compared with the control group, though the effect size was small. Furthermore, we revealed that the effect of health-related messages occurred indirectly by increasing health risk perceptions associated with improper utilization of wild animals. Yet, we did not find a clear effect pathway of the legality-related messages. Regarding the nontarget consumers, information of whistleblowing platforms and incentives improved willingness to report illegal wildlife use directly, as well as indirectly through adding messages to increase perceived legality risk of using wild products and improve self-efficacy in identifying legal products. Our findings can inform future larger scale efforts to influence wildlife consumption.

"Evaluating a large-scale online behaviour change intervention aimed at wildlife product consumers in Singapore
",Singapore,"Interventions to shift the behaviour of consumers using unsustainable wildlife products are key to threatened species conservation. Whether these interventions are effective is largely unknown due to a dearth of detailed evaluations. We previously conducted a country-level online behaviour change intervention targeting consumers of the Critically Endangered saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) horn in Singapore. To evaluate intervention impact, we carried out in-person consumer surveys with >2,000 individuals pre- and post-intervention (2017 and 2019), and 93 in-person post-intervention surveys with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) shopkeepers (2019). The proportion of self-reported high-usage saiga horn consumers in the target audience (Chinese Singaporean women aged 35–59) did not change significantly from pre- to post-intervention (24.4% versus 22.6%). However, post-intervention the target audience was significantly more likely than the non-target audience to accurately recall the intervention message and to report a decrease in saiga horn usage (4% versus 1% reported a behaviour change). Within the target audience, high-usage consumers were significantly more likely than lower-usage consumers to recall the message and report a behaviour change. Across respondents who reported a decrease in saiga horn usage, they cited the intervention message as a specific reason for their behaviour change significantly more than other reasons. Additionally, across all respondents, the belief that saiga is a common species in the wild decreased significantly from pre- to post-intervention. TCM shopkeepers, however, cited factors such as price and availability as the strongest influences on saiga horn sales. In sum, the intervention did significantly influence some consumers but the reduction of high-usage consumer frequency was not significant at the population level. We explore reasons for these findings, including competing consumer influences, characteristics of the intervention, and evaluation timing. This work suggests our intervention approach has potential, and exemplifies a multi-pronged in-person evaluation of an online wildlife trade consumer intervention.

Committing to behavior change: How to prevent dogs from visiting Atlantic Forest remnants?,Brazil,"Behavioral interventions have been applied to induce multiple pro-environmental changes, yet testing their effects on biodiversity conservation is novel. For certain behaviors, a promising tool is changing the context within which people make decisions through nudges. One such behavior is dog restraining to prevent visits to natural areas, a worldwide source of negative impacts on wildlife. In this preliminary study, we experimentally tested the effects of two interventions (i.e., an informative video on conservation and an informative video plus commitment nudge) on changing dog management among rural owners. We then assessed interventions' effects on owners' behavior change (n = 52) and intention to keep the restraining practice in the future (n = 50). Both interventions promoted a momentary change in owners' behavior, but their effect sizes did not differ. Yet, neither treatment increased the owners' intention to maintain the restraining practices. Although nudges alone may not be the most appropriate solution to reduce the severe dog impacts on wildlife, they might be of practical relevance to conservation stakeholders who deal with threats that are not prone to mitigation through more traditional strategies (e.g., command and control).

"Behavioral interventions to reduce unintentional non-native plants introduction: Personal factors matter
",Japan,"To reduce biodiversity loss, human behavioral change is crucial. However, there has been a significant paucity of effective conservation behavioral interventions, which help establish evidence-based policymaking and lead to the understanding of intervention effectiveness mediators. This study focused on preventing the unintentional introduction of non-native species by examining the effectiveness of four behavioral interventions using an experiment and a questionnaire. The interventions sought to induce footwear cleaning, which reduces non-native species introduction via footwear, at a cleaning station. Responses were considerably heterogeneous across interventions—that is, nudging visitors toward the cleaning station using foot-stamps placed on the ground had the largest impact, while providing procedural knowledge also had a significant effect. Further, the impact of these two interventions differed greatly depending on the degree of individuals' knowledge and/or personalized involvement in the unintentional introduction process. To maximize the impact of and improve interventions, we suggest accounting for the personal factors of the targeted individuals.

"Save the Crabs, them eat 'em",USA,"The ""Save the Crabs, Then Eat 'Em"" campaign, developed by the Chesapeake Bay Program and aimed at reducing nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, utilized social marketing techniques to change homeowners' lawn care behaviors. The primary objective was to mitigate the harmful runoff of fertilizers, which contributes to the bay's dead zones where blue crabs and other marine life cannot survive. The campaign focused on the connection between lawn care and the health of the bay, emphasizing that responsible lawn fertilization practices could save the crabs, thus allowing people to continue enjoying them as a culinary delicacy. Key messages highlighted the consequences of over-fertilization, such as algae blooms that deplete oxygen levels in the water, and provided simple, actionable tips for homeowners, like using less fertilizer, planting native grasses, and establishing buffer zones with plants that could absorb excess nutrients. Behavioral insights played a crucial role in the campaign's design. Research indicated that many residents were unaware of the impact their lawn care practices had on the bay. The campaign utilized relatable and engaging messaging to foster a sense of personal responsibility and connection to the bay's health. Additionally, the campaign leveraged existing community norms around the pride of having a well-maintained lawn, reframing responsible lawn care as both environmentally beneficial and a mark of a good neighbor. The campaign's effectiveness was measured through surveys and focus groups, which revealed increased awareness and reported changes in lawn care behaviors among the target audience. The success of the campaign was attributed to its clear, positive messaging and practical advice, making it easy for individuals to adopt new practices that benefit the broader environment.","TARGET 7: Reduce Pollution to Levels That Are Not Harmful to Biodiversity

"The effectiveness and efficiency of using normative messages to reduce waste: A real world experiment
",Portugal,"Although they are only home to 16% of the global human population, high-income countries produce approximately one third of the world’s waste, the majority of which goes to landfills. To reduce pressure on landfills and natural systems, environmental messaging should focus on reducing consumption. Messages that signal social norms have the potential to influence people to reduce their consumption of comfort goods, such as straws, which are not a necessity for most people. We conducted a randomized field-experiment at a marine park in Portugal to test whether different normative messages reduced visitors’ paper straw use when compared to non-normative messages. We found that a message framed around a positive injunctive norm significantly reduced straw use compared to a non-normative message. We estimated that using the message at 17 park concession stands could keep over 27500 straws out of landfills annually and save the park money after two years.

"Surveillance or Self-Surveillance? Behavioral Cues Can Increase the Rate of Drivers’ Pro-Environmental Behavior at a Long Wait Stop
",UK,"By leaving their engines idling for long periods, drivers contribute unnecessarily to air pollution, waste fuel, and produce noise and fumes that harm the environment. Railway level crossings are sites where many cars idle, many times a day. In this research, testing two psychological theories of influence, we examine the potential to encourage drivers to switch off their ignition while waiting at rail crossings. Two field studies presented different signs at a busy rail crossing site with a 2-min average wait. Inducing public self-focus (via a “Watching Eyes” stimulus) was not effective, even when accompanied by a written behavioral instruction. Instead, cueing a private-self focus (“think of yourself”) was more effective, doubling the level of behavioral compliance. These findings confirm the need to engage the self when trying to instigate self-regulatory action, but that cues evoking self-surveillance may sometimes be more effective than cues that imply external surveillance.","TARGET 7: Reduce Pollution to Levels That Are Not Harmful to Biodiversity

We study whether focused media and increased public attention can drive local  environmental action, reducing environmental damage. Although an annual affair, forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon went viral in August 2019, receiving unprecedented public scrutiny. Comparing active fires in Brazil versus those in Peru and Bolivia in a difference-in-differences design, we find that increased public attention reduced fires by 22% avoiding 24.8 million tons of CO2 in emissions.

"Does eco certification sell tourism services? Evidence from a quasi-experimental observation study in Iceland
",Iceland,"Eco-labelling of tourism services has been studied extensively in the past. Yet, there is no agreement on two key points: (1) whether or not eco-certification increases tourist demand for a product among the general tourist population, and (2) whether or not there is a specific market segment whose purchase decisions are influenced by eco-labels. Lack of agreement is partially due to the wide variety of different research approaches used. Most studies have in common, however, that they rely solely on tourist self reports of either behavioural intentions or past behaviour. The present study re-investigates these two questions using a quasi-experimental design based on actual observed behaviour and objective knowledge testing. Results indicate that (1) eco labelling does not have a big impact on general tourist demand, but (2) a niche market exists which is influenced by eco labelling when choosing among alternative tourist providers. The research design used in the present study offers a useful alternative for investigations of tourist purchase decisions. It leads to more reliable results because it is based on the observation of actual displayed behaviour, thus avoiding a range of answer biases. Other eco-certified products now need research on similar lines.
